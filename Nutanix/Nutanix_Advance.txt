Controlling Cluster Access Using Cluster Lockdown
	-> Cluster lockdown can be used to disable password-based authentication and enforce keybased SSH access to the controller VM and the host that have been locked down.
	-> Only the default 'nutanix' and 'admin' accounts can be used to access a CVM or host that are in lockdown.
	-> You can create one or more key pairs and add the public keys to enable key-based SSH access.

======================= Flow =======================
-> Flow's security policies using application-centric policy language
-> You first need to specify the VMs that belong to the application you want to protect
-> Then identify the networks or entities with which you want to allow those VMs to communicate
-> Four types of security policies	-> Application Security Policy	-> Select category for VM
									-> Specify allowed traffic b/w source and destination
									-> Apply policy to those entities only
									-> Block all other traffic
					-> Isolation Environment Policy	-> Block all traffic b/w two groups of VMs
									-> Prod Category VMs will not be able to communicate with DEV Category VMs
									-> Inter category communication is available
					-> Quarantine Policy	-> Isolate an infected VM
					-> VDI Policy	-> Policy based on users and groups in an AD Domain



Characteristics of the default virtual switch (vs0)	-> It cannot be deleted.
							-> The default virtual switch is configured with the Active-Backup uplink bond type.


Acropolis Dynamic Scheduler (ADS)	-> Runs every 15 minutes and analyzes resource usage
					-> Resource utilization of an AHV node > 85% for 15 mins
					-> Storage hotspot	-> 40 mins of data
					-> CPU hotspot	-> CPU Usage over 10 mins
					-> Does not monitor Network / Memory
