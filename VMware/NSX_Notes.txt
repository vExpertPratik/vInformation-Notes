Reverse Proxy Service -> NSX Manager service for registering Transport Node
After NSX 3.0, vDS can use with NSX if vSphere and vDS version is 7 or newer.
For Overlay traffic, MTU on vDS need to be at least 1600, 1700 (Recommended) or 9000 (Jumbo Frame)
No. of Uplinks and Teaming policy defines the number of TEPs created for Transport Node
			-> Failover -> Only one TEP
			-> Load Balance Source -> Balance as per vDS Port ID -> Active - Active -> Multiple TEPs
			-> Load Balance Source - MAC -> Balance as per MAC Hash -> High Compute
esxcli software vib list | grep -E 'nsx|vsip'
vmkping -I (Interface) -s (Size of Package) -d (not defragment) -S vxlan (type of packate) (destination)
Three NSX Forwarding Tables
	-> TEP Table -> Segment VNI to Host TEP IP Address Mapping
	-> ARP Table -> VM IP to MAC Mapping
	-> MAC Table -> VM MAC to Host TEP IP Address Mapping
Intratier Transit Link -> T0 to T1
If T0 HA Mode is active active, then we can not run centralized services (NAT, VPN, Firewall)
The Data Plane Development Kit (DPDK) is a set of data plane libraries and network interface controller drivers for fast packet processing
DFW 	-> Ethernet -> L2 Rule
	-> Emergency -> Quaratine Purpose
	-> Infrastructure -> DNS, DHCP, AD
	-> Environment -> based on type (Prod, Non-Prod)
	-> Application -> Layer 7
	-> on ESXi Host
		-> summarize-dvfilter | grep -n 3 <VMName>
		-> Get the vNIC name of stateful firewall
		-> vsipioctl getrules -f <vNIC Name>
			-> You can decrypt the address set
			-> vsipioctl getaddrset -f <vNIC Name>
				-> This will show the IP and MAC address

Syslog	-> NSX Manager and Edge Node
		-> set logging-server <IP_ADDR> proto <udp/tcp/tls> level <emer/alert/crit/err/warning/notice/info/debug>
	-> ESXi
		-> esxcli system syslog config set --loghost=udp://<IP_ADDR>  --log-level=debug
		-> esxcli system syslog reload
		-> esxcli system syslog config get

Password Management	-> NSX Manager
			-> get auth-policy cli lockout-period/max-auth-failures
			-> set user <username> password-expiration <1-9999>
			-> clear user <username> password-expiration


Edge-bridge Profile	-> HA for Edge Cluster
			-> Premptive	-> Move all the tasks once node is back
			-> Non-premptive -> wait until another node is up and running fine


Edge Cluster	-> Deploy new Edge Node
		-> Go to Edge Cluster -> Go to Action -> Replace Edge Node from to
