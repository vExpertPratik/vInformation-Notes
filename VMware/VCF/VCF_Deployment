VCF Deployment

VMware Licensing Matrix (May 2023): https://www.vmware.com/content/dam/digitalmarketing/vmware/en/pdf/products/cloud-foundation/vmw-vcf-edition-matrix.pdf
  -> Minimum of 4 physical nodes required for management workload domain
  -> Minimum of 3 physical nodes required for VI workload domain

  -> VMware Cloud Foundation Architecture
    -> Standard Architecture
      -> Different Mangement Workload domain and VI Workload domains
      -> Minimum of 7 physical nodes required for deployment
    -> Consolidated
      -> Customers with a small environment (or a PoC) with all in one environment
      -> Minimum of 4 physical nodes required for deployment

Cloud Builder VM Deployment
VMware Documentation  -> https://docs.vmware.com/en/VMware-Cloud-Foundation/3.10/vcf-deploy/GUID-CB40D2E9-0714-4152-98D6-F9A5ACC074C7.html

For deploying the vCF, we need to first deploy the cloud builder VM which includes VMware Imaging Appliance for installing ESXi
  -> Cloud builder VM will deploy and configure the MGMT Domain and transfer inventory and control to SDDC Manager
  -> During deployment of MGMT Domain Cloud Builder VM validates Network Information
    -> DNS
    -> Network (vLANs, IPs, MTUs)
    -> NTP's
    -> Credentials
  -> Both the ESXi Nodes and Cloud Builder VM should be in same L2 domain

#============================================================================================================================================================================#

ESXi Imaging

You can use two method
  -> Manually prepare the host with supported version of ESXi
  -> Use VMware Imaging Appliance (VIA)
    -> Download Supported ESXi ISO and vSphere Installation Bundles (VIBs)
      -> Can verify the Bill of Material (BOM) section of respective vCF Documentation
    -> SSH to Cloud Builder VM and update respective Network information in "via.properties" file available in "/opt/vmware/evorack-imaging/config" directory
    -> Restart the imaging service "systemctl restart imaging.service"
    -> Login with admin credentials on Cloud builder VM Portal available on "https://<Cloud_Builder_VM_IP>:8445/via"
      -> Upload the ESXi ISO and VIBs under "Bundle" section
      -> Use "Imaging" section for updating IP, hostname and NTP details for respective ESXi hosts
    -> Post Imaging we can modify the vLAN Tagging
    -> Default root credentials will be "root" and "EvoSddc!2016"

#============================================================================================================================================================================#

Initiate the Cloud Foundation Bring-Up Process

Logs for this steps will be stored on Cloud Builder VM under 
  -> /opt/vmware/bringup/logs/vcf-bringup-debug.log

  -> Download and complete the deployment Parameter sheet
    -> This sheet includes information about networks (Network IP Pools, NTP, Distriubted switches, IPs), hosts, license keys, NSX Managers, credentials
  -> You can upload the updated file on Cloud builder VM Portal by navigating to "https://<Cloud_Builder_VM_IP>"
  -> After updating the sheet, audit tasks are performed for validation
    -> JSON/XLSX Validation
    -> Host and IP DNS Records
    -> ESXi Host Readiness
    -> vSAN Disk Availability
    -> License Key Format
    -> Password Validation
    -> Network Configuration
    -> Network Connectivity
    -> Time Synchronization
    -> Network IP Pools
    -> Cloud Builder Readiness
    -> ESXi Host version  -> Compare with manifest file located in "/opt/evosddc/bundle/scripts/manifest.json"

  -> Once Bring up is succesful, Configure the Dual Authentication for certain tasks, such as updating or rotating passwords and configuring NSX Manager backups
    -> Log into management vCenter Server using the vSphere Client.
    -> Navigate to "Administration > Single Sign On > Users and Groups".
    -> Add new user
    -> Create a group named "Sddc_Secured_Access" and add the new user in this group to make that user a privilege user
  -> The administrator@vsphere.local user cannot be the privileged user.

Troubleshooting Cloud Foundation Deployment

  -> Supportability and Serviceability (SoS) Tool

    -> Run SoS tool operations in the Cloud Builder VM to debug a failed bring-up of Cloud Foundation.
    -> To run the SOS Tool follow below steps  -> SSH into Cloud Builder as admin
                                        -> Run command "su", to switch to the root user
                                        -> Run command "cd /opt/vmware/sddc-support/", to switch to respective directory
                                        -> Run command "./sos --option-1 --option-2...--option-n"
                                        -> You can use below options
                                          -> --help / -h
                                            -> Provide a summary of the available SOS tool options
                                          -> --version / -v
                                            -> Provides the SOS Tool's version number
                                          -> --force
                                            -> Allows SoS operations from the Cloud Builder VM after bring-up.
                                          -> --health-check
                                            -> Performs all available health checks.
