  -> psql -h localhost -U postgres
  -> "\x" for extended the commands
  -> "\c platform" for connecting to Platform database
  -> "select * from vcf_network where type=’VMOTION’;" for printing the IP used for VMOTION
  -> update vcf_network set used_ip_addresses='["IP_ADD_1","IP_ADD_2"]' where id='<ID_of_Network_Record>';
  -> update vcf_network set free_ip_addresses='["IP_ADD_1"]' where id='<ID_of_Network_Record>';

Skip Hosts During ESXi Update
  ->  curl 'https://<SDDC_MANAGER_IP>/v1/hosts' -i -u '<username:password>' -X GET -H 'Accept: 
application/json' |json_pp
    -> Copy the Host ID
  -> Open the /opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application-prod.properties file
  -> Add the below line at the end of file
    -> esx.upgrade.skip.host.ids=<hostid1>,<hostid2>
  -> systemctl restart lcm


Upgrade ESXi with Cloud Foundation Stock ISO and Async Drivers
  -> Create a directory for the vendor provided async drivers under the /nfs/vmware/vcf/
 nfs-mount directory. For example, /nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/esx-upgrade-partner
drivers/drivers
  -> chmod -R 775 /nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/esx-upgrade-partner-drivers/drivers
  ->  chown -R vcf_lcm:vcf /nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/esx-upgrade-partner
drivers/drivers
  -> Create Custom JSON File
 {
 "esxCustomImageSpecList": [{
 "bundleId": "ID",
 "useVcfBundle": true,
 "esxPatchesAbsolutePaths": [
 "Path_to_Drivers"
 ]
 }]
 }

  -> Save the JSON file as esx-custom-image-upgrade-spec.json in the /nfs/vmware/vcf/
 nfs-mount.
  -> chmod -R 775 /nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/esx-custom-image-upgrade-spec.json
  -> chown -R vcf_lcm:vcf /nfs/vmware/vcf/nfs-mount/esx-custom-image-upgrade
spec.json

  -> Open the /opt/vmware/vcf/lcm/lcm-app/conf/application-prod.properties file.
  -> In the lcm.esx.upgrade.custom.image.spec= parameter, add the path to the JSON file.
